 < synopsis > In a courthouse , an eighteen - year - old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death . Final closing arguments having been presented , a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder . If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty . The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence . The jury retires to a private room , where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating . It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty , and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of 8 ( ) , who is the only " not guilty " vote in a preliminary tally . He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first . His vote annoys the other jurors , especially 7 ( ) , who has tickets to a baseball game that evening ; and 10 ( ) , who believes that people from backgrounds are liars , wild , and dangerous . The rest of the film 's focus is the jury 's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict . While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices , 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial , and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation . He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder , the " rarity " of the murder weapon ( a common switchblade , of which he has an identical copy ) , and the overall questionable circumstances . He further argues that he can not in good conscience vote " guilty " when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy 's guilt . Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others , 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury . Instead , he requests another vote , this time by secret ballot . He proposes that he will abstain from voting , and if the other 11 jurors are still unanimous in a guilty vote , then he will acquiesce to their decision . The secret ballot is held , and a new " not guilty " vote appears . This earns intense criticism from 3 ( ) , who blatantly accuses 5 ( ) who had grown up in a slum of switching out of sympathy toward slum children . However , 9 ( ) reveals that he himself changed his vote , feeling that 8 's points deserve further discussion . Juror 8 presents a convincing argument that one of the witnesses , an elderly man who claimed to have heard the boy yell " I 'm going to kill you " shortly before the murder took place , could not have heard the voices as clearly as he had testified due to an elevated train passing by at the time ; as well as stating that " I 'm going to kill you , " is often said by people who do not literally mean it . Juror 5 changes his vote to " not guilty " . Soon afterward , 11 ( ) questions whether it is reasonable to suppose the defendant would have fled the scene , having cleaned the knife of fingerprints but leaving it behind , and then come back three hours later to retrieve it ( having been left in his father 's chest ) . Juror 11 then changes his vote . Juror 8 then mentions the man 's second claim : upon hearing the father 's body hit the floor , he had run to the door of his apartment and seen the defendant running out of the building from his front door in 15 seconds . 5 , 6 and 8 question whether this is true , as the witness in question had had a stroke , limiting his ability to walk . Upon the end of an experiment , the jury finds that the witness would not have made it to the door in enough time to actually see the killer running out . Juror 8 concludes that , judging from what he claims to have heard earlier , the witness must have merely assumed it was the defendant running . Juror 3 , growing more irritated throughout the process , explodes in a rant : " He 's got to burn ! He 's slipping through our fingers ! " Juror 8 takes him to task , calling him a " self - appointed public avenger " and a sadist , saying he wants the defendant to die because of personal desire rather than the facts . Juror 3 shouts " I 'll kill him ! " and starts lunging at 8 , but is restrained by 5 and 7 . Juror 8 calmly retorts , " You do n't really mean you 'll kill me , do you ? " , proving his previous point . 2 ( ) and 6 ( ) also decide to vote " not guilty " , tying the vote at 6 - 6 . Soon after , a rainstorm hits the city , apparently postponing the baseball game for which 7 has tickets , thus allowing him to relax and pay attention with that schedule pressure relieved . Juror 4 ( ) continues to state that he does not believe the boy 's alibi , which was being at the movies with a few friends at the time of the murder , because the boy could not remember what movie he had seen when questioned by police shortly after the murder . Juror 8 explains that being under emotional stress can make you forget certain things , and tests how well Juror 4 can remember the events of previous days . Juror 4 remembers , with some difficulty , the events of the previous five days , and Juror 8 points out that he had not been under emotional stress at that time , thus there was no reason to think the boy should be able to remember the particulars of the movie that he claimed to have seen . Juror 2 calls into question the prosecution 's claim that the accused , who was " tall , was able to inflict the downward wound found on his father , who was 6'2 " . Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see if it 's possible for a shorter person to stab downward into a taller person . The experiment proves the possibility , but 5 then explains that he had grown up amidst knife fights in his neighborhood , and shows , through demonstrating the correct use of a switchblade , that no one so much shorter than his opponent would have held a switchblade in such a way as to stab downward , as the grip would have been too awkward and the act of changing hands too time - consuming . Rather , someone that much shorter than his opponent would stab underhanded at an upwards angle . This revelation augments the certainty of several of the jurors in their belief that the defendant is not guilty . Increasingly impatient , 7 changes his vote just so that the deliberation may end , which earns him the ire of 3 and 11 , both on opposite sides of the discussion . Juror 11 , an immigrant who has repeatedly displayed strong patriotic pride , presses 7 hard about using his vote frivolously , and eventually 7 admits that he now truly believes the defendant is not guilty . The next jurors to change their votes are 12 ( ) and the ( ) , making the vote 9 - 3 and leaving only three dissenters : 3 , 4 and 10 . Outraged at how the proceedings have gone , 10 goes into a rage on why people from the slums can not be trusted , of how they are little better than animals who gleefully kill each other off for fun . His speech offends 5 , who turns his back to him , and one by one the rest of the jurors start turning away from him . Confused and disturbed by this reaction to his diatribe , 10 continues in a steadily fading voice and manner , slowing to a stop with " Listen to me . Listen ... " Juror 4 , the only man still facing him , tersely responds , " I have . Now sit down and do n't open your mouth again . " As 10 moves to sit in a corner by himself , 8 speaks quietly about the evils of prejudice , and the other jurors slowly resume their seats . When those remaining in favor of a guilty vote are pressed as to why they still maintain that there is no reasonable doubt , 4 states his belief that despite all the other evidence that has been called into question , the fact remains that the woman who saw the murder from her bedroom window across the street ( through the passing train ) still stands as solid evidence . After he points this out , 12 changes his vote back to " guilty " , making the vote 8 - 4.Then 9 , after seeing 4 rub his nose ( which is being irritated by his eye glasses ) , realizes that , like 4 , the woman who allegedly saw the murder had impressions in the sides of her nose which she rubbed , indicating that she wore glasses , but did not wear them to court out of vanity . Juror 8 cannily asks 4 if he wears his eyeglasses to sleep , and 4 admits that he does not wear them nobody does . Juror 8 explains that there was thus no logical reason to expect that the witness happened to be wearing her glasses while trying to sleep , and he points out that on her own evidence the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on . After he points this out , 12 , 10 and 4 all change their vote to " not guilty" . At this point , the only remaining juror with a guilty vote is 3 . Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments , ending with , " kids , you work your life out ! " This builds on a more emotionally ambivalent earlier revelation that his relationship with his own son is deeply strained , and his anger over this fact is the main reason that he wants the defendant to be guilty . Juror 3 finally loses his temper and tears up a photo of himself and his son , then suddenly breaks down crying and changes his vote to " not guilty " , making the vote unanimous . As the jurors leave the room , 8 helps the distraught 3 with his coat in a show of compassion . The film ends when the friendly 8 ( ) and 9 ( ) exchange names , and all of the jurors descend the courthouse steps to return to their individual lives ... never to see each other again.(Note : there is no indication nor is the question ever answered if the teenage boy really is guilty or not ; instead the film makes it clear that this is outside of the question if the jurors can not be certain that he is guilty , if there is any reasonable doubt , they must acquit him.)</synopsis >
